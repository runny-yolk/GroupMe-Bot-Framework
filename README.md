# GroupMe Bot Framework
I created this awhile ago, so I could easily set up multiple bots on the same NodeJS application.

It comes with 3 bots: hellobot, rickbot, and garblebot.

Hellobot just says hello back to whoever says hello to it,
Rickbot tries to respond as Rick from Rick and Morty,
and Garblebot garbles the text you give it, by using Yandex Translate.

The code is commented heavily, only assuming a basic knowledge of JavaScript and NodeJS, although anything you don't know, the comments should give enough context for you to Google.

This application is also configured to be suitable for Heroku deployment, since this is my preferred deployment method.
